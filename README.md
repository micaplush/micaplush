Hi, I'm Mica!

I'm an enby dev/sysadmin kinda person (trying to avoid the buzzword 🤐). You can find out what I'm currently doing at [mica.lgbt](https://mica.lgbt) or contact me using the channels listed there. They/them or she/her pronouns are appreciated!

To avoid confusion: This account was recently renamed from [@T0astBread](https://github.com/T0astBread). It's "micaplush" now because every other good variation of "mica" was taken and plushies are cute.
